Assignment Details
-------------------
The goal of this assignment was to build a calculator using the above technologies.

The logic for the calculator is housed on the server. The client side takes in the type of the mathematical operation and the input values from two input text fields. The mathematical operation is then bundled up into an object and sent to the server via POST.

Once the server receives the object, the numbers are computed through logic and sent back down to the client side app where it is displayed on the DOM.

Finally, there is a clear button which resets the experience.
