Assignment Details
-------------------
The goal of this assignment is to build a calculator using the above technologies.

The logic for the calculator will be housed on the server. The client side takes in the type of the mathematical operation and the input values from two input text fields. The mathematical operation will then be bundled up into an object and sent to the server via POST.

Once the server receives the object, the numbers will be computed through logic and sent back down to the client side app where it will be displayed on the DOM.

Finally, there will be a clear button which resets the experience.
